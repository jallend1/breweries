# Brewery Finder 1.0

I like coding! I like breweries! Here, they combine to form some kind of React Voltron of my interests!

Just search for a brewery, and it pops up! Presto! You can also browse by states, if you're into that action.

This is super simple and not at all comprehensive. Mostly just using it as an excuse to expand my familiarity with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Thanks!

The good folks over at [OpenBreweryDB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) were indispensible in making this brewery API available and giving me something interesting to play around with while I learn coding.

Also a big shout out to [Kevin Thorn](https://community.articulate.com/discussions/building-better-courses/50-us-states-transparent-png-and-two-colors) for making the state maps available for schmucks like me.
